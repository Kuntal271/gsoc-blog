# Week 8 at GSOC: Implementing Mouse Interactions for 3D Plots  in LabPlot

As I conclude the eighth week of my Google Summer of Code (GSOC) project with LabPlot, I'm excited to share a major enhancement to the 3D plot interaction experience. This week, I focused on integrating mouse-based controls for 3D interactions by implementing the `MouseInteractor`, which extends `QAbstract3DInputHandler` from QtGraphs.

## Enhancing 3D Plot Control with Mouse Interaction

Previously, users had to rely on sliders within the dockwidgets to control aspects of the 3D plot, such as zooming and rotating. While these sliders provided functionality, they lacked the intuitive feel of direct mouse interactions. To improve this, we introduced the `MouseInteractor`.

## What is the `MouseInteractor`?

The `MouseInteractor` is a custom implementation designed to handle mouse interactions for 3D plots, offering several advantages:

- **Zooming**: Users can zoom in and out by using mouse scroll gestures, providing a more natural way to adjust the view.
- **Rotation**: By clicking and dragging the mouse, users can rotate the 3D plot, making it easier to explore the data from various angles.
- **Panning**: The mouse can also be used for panning, allowing users to move the view of the plot horizontally or vertically.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Integration with QtGraphs**: The `MouseInteractor` extends `QAbstract3DInputHandler`, which interfaces seamlessly with QtGraphs' 3D rendering capabilities.
- **Complementary to Sliders**: While sliders remain available in the dockwidgets, the `MouseInteractor` provides an additional, more direct method of interacting with the 3D plot.
- **Improved User Experience**: This addition enhances the user experience by offering more fluid and responsive control over 3D interactions.

## Challenges and Solutions

Implementing the `MouseInteractor` presented some challenges:

- **Event Handling**: Integrating mouse events with QtGraphs' 3D scene required precise handling to ensure smooth and accurate interactions.
- **Maintaining Slider Functionality**: Ensuring that the new mouse interactions complemented the existing slider controls without causing conflicts or confusion.

Despite these challenges, the `MouseInteractor` has been successfully integrated, providing users with a more intuitive way to interact with 3D plots.

## Next Steps

Looking ahead, our focus will be on:

- **Refining Interaction**: Further fine-tuning the `MouseInteractor` based on user feedback to enhance its performance and usability.
- **Expanding Features**: Exploring additional mouse-based interactions and features to enrich the user experience.
- **Updating Documentation**: Enhancing documentation and creating tutorials to help users make the most of the new interaction capabilities.

The introduction of the `MouseInteractor` represents a significant improvement in how users interact with LabPlot’s 3D visualizations. This enhancement, alongside the existing slider controls, aims to offer a versatile and user-friendly experience. I’m eager to see how these new features will benefit users and look forward to continuing this exciting project.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and refine LabPlot’s 3D plotting capabilities!
