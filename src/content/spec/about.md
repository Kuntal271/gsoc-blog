# About Me

Hello! I'm Kuntal Bar, a passionate student and open-source enthusiast currently pursuing my studies at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Gwalior (IIIT Gwalior) in Madhya Pradesh, India.

## My Open-Source Journey

Open-source development is not just a hobby for me; it's a passion that drives my work and learning. I've had the privilege of contributing to several significant open-source projects, including:

- **LabPlot**: A powerful data visualization and analysis tool
- **Cantor**: An application for scientific computing within the KDE ecosystem
- **Plotly**: A popular graphing library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs

These experiences have not only honed my skills but also deepened my appreciation for collaborative software development.

## Technical Expertise

My areas of expertise include:

- **Qt Development**: Proficient in creating robust, cross-platform applications
- **DevOps**: Experienced in streamlining development processes and improving deployment efficiency
- **AI ML**: Skilled in various AI and Machine Learning frameworks, particularly those used in data analysis and modeling

## Current Focus

I'm currently engaged in a Google Summer of Code (GSOC) project with LabPlot, where I'm working on expanding its 2D visualization capabilities to include 3D plotting. This project allows me to combine my passion for open-source development with my technical skills in Qt and data visualization.

## Looking Forward

I'm always excited about new challenges and opportunities to learn. Whether it's diving deeper into AI and ML applications or contributing to more open-source projects, I'm eager to grow and make meaningful contributions to the tech community.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss open-source, Qt development, AI ML, or anything tech-related. I'm always happy to connect with fellow enthusiasts and learners!
